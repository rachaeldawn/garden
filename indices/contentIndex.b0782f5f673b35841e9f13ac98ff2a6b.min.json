You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

I was trying to come up with a concise definition of what it could possibly mean, and how you could put it into words. I was talking with someone who is not of the same blood and whose relationship with me has shifted into more of a family bond when the definition came clearly to me.\n\nThe measure of family is a bond with one person or many whose support and presence is uplifting and enriching in a way that counteracts the conflicts, struggles, and difficulties in life, in spite of the squabbles and problems within that system. I may argue with you, and be angry with you for some reason, but all that falls away as irrelevant the moment something has hurt you because not only are you important to me, but how you are, who you are, and how healthy your life as a whole is, is important to me.\n\nThe hurt experienced by one is shared, and the healing is taken up by one or many in that family system. Even in situations where one specific individual is less capable of offering assistance, that same individual holds concern for, and care of, the one who has been hurt. The achievements of anyone are celebrated as a whole, and the good fortune is automatically shared among this system of family.\n\nFamily for some can look like a tree of trees, sprawling out in multiple directions. For others, it's a single node (you) connected to a series of trees. It may even be small, with 1 node connected to 1 other node, or 1 node connected to many, but those many are not connected with one another. Family is a unique, individual experience that can be shared across many individuals.","lastmodified":"2023-04-02T16:24:12.160178463Z","tags":[]},"/private/programming/visual-blocking":{"title":"Code Should Read Like English","content":"\n\nCompare the two code snippets ...\n\n\n```typescript\nasync function register(email: string, password: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  // verify email\n  if (/^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$/.test(email) !== true) {\n    alert('invalid email provided!')\n    return\n  }\n\n  // password length check\n  if (password.length \u003c 8) {\n    alert('password must be at least 8 characters');\n    return\n  }\n\n  // password is \"secure\"\n  if (\n    /\\w/.test(password) !== true\n    \u0026\u0026 /[A-Z]/.test(password) !== true\n    \u0026\u0026 /[0-9]/.test(password) !== true\n    || /[!@#$%^\u0026*()_+\\-=\\[\\]{};':\"\\\\|,.\u003c\u003e\\/?]/.test(password) !== true\n  ) {\n    alert('Password must have at least 1 upper case, 1 lower case, 1 number, and 1 special character');\n    return\n  }\n\n  // user isn't already logged in\n  if (localStorage.get('app:login-token')) {\n    // open the modal saying they're already logged in\n    alert('You are already logged in!');\n    return\n  }\n\n  const response = await http.post('https://my-api.dev.example.com/register', { body: { email, password } });\n  \n  if (response.body.code === 409) {\n    alert('Email already in use!')\n  } else if (response.body.code === 400) {\n    alert('Uh oh!

What impact does this have on the bigger picture? What resources are you going to need to accomplish this task? How big is this task? Is the trade-off of how much this is going to cost against how much this helps the big picture worth it? Can you delegate this task to someone else, and _should you_? What will completion look, feel, and be like?\n\nThese are the questions you want to start with, especially for larger tasks that are an umbrella for a lot of smaller ones. Proposing these questions to yourself means that you understand the task at hand, and that you've adequately prepared yourself. If the questions above seem pointless, it's because you're focusing on the to-do list and not the journey to the outcome.\n\n### Prediction of Challenges\nWho is going to be in your way? What in your environment is going to drain your capacity? What resources are going to be difficult to attain? How much task-inertia needs to be built up from scratch? How many question marks are you sitting on?\n\nAsking these questions allows you to keep reality in the same picture as your outcome. Obviously you don't want to be a pessimist with all you do, but realism is a critical element of accomplishment. You _do_ need to be pessimistic as a counter-balance to the optimism of your intended outcome. It'll also help you understand what is actually going to happen, and limit risks involved in execution. This is not going to be perfect, and you shouldn't drain yourself on this, but having an awareness is going to significantly increase your likelihood of managing problems.\n\n### Outline of Outcomes\nDifferent kinds of productivity need different systems of execution. Is it a project? Is it a user-story? Is it a sales goal, or a meeting? What do you want to see? Use these questions to consider the picture in your head of what success can be measured by. This is where you want to not only specify what you want to achieve, but also your estimated _likelihood_ of achieving said outcomes.\n\nThis is also where you can reflect on _just how much impact_ this has on your overall goals. Note that all of your goals should be attached to meaningful values, such as having a sustainable foundation to support your family, expressing excellence in your work to find meaning in what you do, etc.\n\n\n---\nWIP, to be continued","lastmodified":"2023-04-02T16:24:12.160178463Z","tags":["productivity","unfinished"]},"/programming/beginner-resources":{"title":"Resources for Beginners","content":"\n## Getting started\nIn order to get started programming, you honestly just need to try a bit of programming and see what you think.

I came to terms with who I am, and accepted myself in January of 2021. I battled with myself for as long as I can remember on my identity, but there's some key things that are not so obvious that I want to share. One thing is for sure, I am as certain as I have ever been about anything with this process of transitioning, but that doesn't mean I don't have \"doubts\". These doubts are a result of my story, and I want to share this element of myself with the world in case you know someone who is following a path like my own. \n\nEveryone's journey is their own and I do not claim to speak on behalf of anyone but myself. My journey is atypical from what *I have seen*, but I haven't met a lot of trans people. From the stories I have read, I *feel* my path is different than the \"obvious\" situations where someone is trans. It is this reason that I want to share, because it's not a one size fits all thing. People in my situation who weren't obvious would sooner stay silent than share because they're scared, just like I was.\n\n## Identity Crises\n\nIf I trace back throughout my life, I can see the million signs that were *so obvious* from my perspective now. The problem is that I didn't know back then for a few reasons. I had no reference point, I thought I was stuck, and I grew up in a world where you had to \"be the man\" if you were born male. Men were not supposed to be \"girly\" in ***any way at all.*** You can imagine the distress that this causes someone who doesn't want to be masculine.\n\nMy mother told me that when I was a kid, I used to get frustrated that I couldn't join in when she would do my sisters' nail polish but not mine. She compromised and gave me a clear coat. When I was young, I would want to wear girl's clothing and have always been drawn to it. The first time I tried something on, I wore it for a day before I realized that my mother would find out. I *knew* that she would think differently of me if she found out I wore that. So I stuffed it inside my pants, and naturally she found it while washing my clothes. When my mother questioned me I was so embarrassed that I just wanted it to be done and over with. My sister Jada and I used to go digging through our mother's dresser to try her clothes on as well. It was fun for us, but these were the first signs that showed themselves. I was 4-7 with the nail polish, and I was 7-8 with the clothing events. I knew then something was up but I didn't know what it was.\n\n\u003e An interesting side note:\n\u003e \n\u003e I always found it rather irritating that my mother had 3 girls and 1 boy. I always thought it would just make more sense to have 4 girls.\n\nHere's the thing though: I wasn't really interested in \"girly\" things by default. Even to this day I'm not a super femme person and I don't want to be. It's not who I am. I liked Lego, video games, super powers / heroes, computers, stuff like that. But then I liked shows like Sailor Moon, Zoboomafoo, etc, which most people would look at and think instantly that it was geared for little girls. I had no problems playing with dolls and barbies because the dolls would simply be a delegate for me. I would want to play out scenarios and be \"older\", a desire that *everyone* who knew me as a child is very familiar with. Nothing really concrete that says \"yes, something is up with this child\".\n\nIn my teens I asked my sister if I could try on her bra. \"But you can't tell *anyone* about this. I mean it, please don't tell anyone. I'm just curious\". I called it a torture device, but it felt right to me. That was the first time I felt truly conflicted and frustrated because I felt like I should *have* these and have a *reason* for these. By this time I was familiar with all the homophobic / transphobic slurs. Tranny, she-man, faggot, homo, fudge packer, queer, the list goes on. I knew them, and I knew the pressure they caused. These words played in my head as I experienced my first real identity crisis. Jada didn't see it, but taking that bra off *hurt* in a way I did not have words to describe. It felt like something mattered was being stolen from me, despite it not even *being my bra*. \n\nOver the course of years I would experience repeated ***burning*** impulses to wear women's clothing. I would resist as much as I could, but it would eat me alive before I inevitably failed. I couldn't walk by clothing stores without having to look away, I couldn't pass all those makeup and jewelry shops without feeling drawn to them, and I couldn't see beautiful women without feeling a little jealous mixed with a lot of self loathing. I hated clothing shopping because I just *didn't want* to buy men's clothing at all. It was irritating to me, so I always wore jeans and a T-Shirt, maybe a hoodie when it was cold. I did this because it was the bare minimum I had to wear to not be naked, and it didn't take any effort to think about. It also meant that I could hide myself. But every time I saw women's clothing, that familiar sadness, sense of loss, and the phrases that kept me from being me would come alive in my head.\n\nPhrases that I've heard over my life would play beyond the slurs. \"If it has boy parts, it's a boy\", \"what are you, gay?\", and \"I ain't someone's bitch\" to name a few. Whenever I would struggle with my identity, these would play in my head. I would feel this intense conflict inside that I did not have the words to describe, a conflict which would not be accepted in the world I lived in. \"Man up\", \"only real men...\", \"real men don't...\", \"be a man\", \"man of the house\". These were the shackles I wore because I was *terrified*. I had already \"lost\" what felt like my entire family because of drugs, and I had already never been able to keep friends because I moved so much. I chose to suffer over choosing to make this feeling better because I couldn't lose any more. I was 13.\n\nIn Jr. High, I started hanging around girls *a lot*. I preferred female or neutral company. The boys didn't make any sense to me. I didn't understand why they acted the way they did. I didn't understand the \"hunter\" mentality of chasing after girls. I didn't understand why girls couldn't just ask guys out that they liked, and I certainly didn't understand the teasing they all did of each other. The \"bro\" conversations, \"bro code\", all that stuff made absolutely no sense to me and it was alienating. I didn't identify with them at all, and I felt shame. I felt humiliated for simply *being male*.\n\nOn top of all the struggles I was facing with the aftermath of child protective services getting involved, I started hating every fiber of myself. I hated my reflection, I hated the body hair I grew, I hated my face, my height, my shape, my stature, my short hair, everything. Until recently I couldn't even stand looking at my face in a mirror. I actually built up a habit to *never* look at my face in a mirror unless I was inspecting my imperfections. I hated pictures because I would have to *see* that face, and when people told me I looked good? I would feel a mixture of frustration and discomfort because it felt like a ***lie**.* I tried to fix the issues I could by shaving everything and growing my hair out, but it got to the point where dissociating from reality and existing in my head was easier than fighting a losing battle.\n\nWhen I was the age of majority, I was immediately drawn to adult stores. I could not control it, and I couldn't stop myself. Oh boy did I try, but it was no use. Every single inch, every fiber, every part of my body was screaming at me for *days* until I would cave. Nothing solved it, nothing stopped it, and nothing helped. I couldn't make it go away. I was mostly out as bisexual, and I would remind myself of this every time I would go, but I was terrified of being in these stores. I knew what I wanted, and I couldn't stop looking at it all from across the shop. I would muster up the courage to buy the toys I wanted, but my heart was pounding with fear the entire time. Even at 25 I still feel that same pressure, that fear, the racing heart, and the shame of being in there because of what I was there to buy.\n\nThis started a pattern that lasted *years*. I would feel restless, anxious, frustrated. The little voice in my head would start pushing me to go buy things to express and indulge in my femme side. I would fight and stress out for days, I would struggle to control my anger, I couldn't think straight. It felt like an addiction, and for the longest time I thought it was. It was like a part of me was pounding on the walls at all hours of the day, screaming at the top of its lungs to \"just do it\" until I finally caved. I would get home, and it was like a binge. I'd try to get whatever I needed out of my system out, and then I'd feel ashamed. The next week or so would be a daily pattern of needing to express that side of me, followed by shame. Reminders of what addiction has done to my family would come up, the shame of \"a man being like this\", and what people would think if they found out would tear me apart and I'd throw it all out. That part of me would die down and stay silent for a month or so before it repeated itself. I've literally thrown away thousands of dollars over the years because of this.\n\nWhen I was ~18 I found something that hurt in a way I lacked the words to explain, and should've been the sign I needed to listen to myself. I was browsing the infamous 4chan one day when I saw this thing called \"XChange\". It's pornographic so don't search it up unless you're ready to see that sorta thing, but the concept is very very simple. It's a pink or blue pill that biologically flips your sex either for a short time, a month, or permanently. When I found this out, I immediately started scouring the internet to see where I could buy some. I was desperate to find it, and *I wanted it*. When I found there were no traces of it anywhere, and that it was fake? I felt that same sense of loss all over again, and it killed that day for me. My hopes were raised and dashed in 10 minutes that I didn't have a chance to be the person I secretly wanted to be.\n\nThat person I secretly wanted to be also meant that all my relationships with women over the years were a struggle. They hurt, they were confusing, and I felt like a failure as a human being because all romantic relationships had the same problem: me. My identity crisis would flare up, I stopped being able to connect with them, and the relationship whithered. It happened like clockwork, and it started showing its face with me burying myself in my work to distance myself from them. Even being intimate would lose all of its shine because there is nothing like trying to be intimate with someone and feeling deeply jealous that you can't just be them. It's a feeling I don't wish upon anyone because it tarnishes something that's supposed to be special and fun.\n\nI lied to myself for years that nothing was wrong. I lied to everyone around me, passing off my behaviors as \"eccentric\", as \"I'm bisexual\", as \"I'm just weird\". In truth it was the real me dying to get out, slipping out like a water droplet off a drippy pipe in every interaction I had with the world. These regular identity crises plagued me and consumed my life. They were one of many sources of depression, of self hatred, of struggle, and of shame. They are part of the reason I know who I am.\n\n## My Catalyst\n\nDecember 2020 rolled around. I had just quit my job in October because I burnt out, my girlfriend and I had split up, and I had plans to be back home for 2 weeks so I could see my family. My relationship failed because we were simply incompatible, despite her being one of the most amazing people I've ever met. At the end of our relationship, that regular identity crisis started flaring up again making it really hard to connect with her. I know she suffered a bit from this, and that she could feel it. When it ended I felt relieved because a part of me knew I could explore my identity now and indulge again, despite it being painful that it ended at all.\n\nSpending 2 weeks around my family, I was suppressing around the clock. I couldn't show my father, or any of my family. My emotional suppression techniques were failing, and I started cracking under the pressure. I was on Tinder around this time, swiping *all day* trying to validate myself \"as a man\" through a successful hetero-normal relationship. It was desperate and never going to work. I hit the point where I had swiped on *every single woman* on Tinder in Calgary. Expanding the filters to the maximum \"acceptable limits\" (distance, age, etc) still showed nobody. I figured what the hell, I'll turn the guys filter on. I'm bisexual and having no luck with women, so why not? The influx of likes and matches happened as it always had before. I got talking to one particular guy named Ajay. 6'2, soft features while still masculine, pretty attractive all around. He gave me one compliment that shattered everything, and left me feeling so conflicted. \"You're beautiful\".\n\nThat's all he had to say, but it felt like my insides were falling out. It felt like my emotions were bursting out of every part of my body, and I couldn't catch any of it. I felt confused, seen, accepted, uncomfortable, happy, and scared. Confused because \"guys don't get those compliments\", seen and accepted because it *felt right* and I didn't know why. I was uncomfortable because my world came crashing down, happy because it felt like I could be the soft person I always felt I was, and scared because it meant that I was exposed now. This one crisis lasted the longest it ever did because all of my usual \"coping mechanisms\" to keep it at bay were entirely unavailable to me. By the time I left for home I was so wound up, frustrated, angry, and on edge that I just wanted to get home.\n\nI started digging into the conflict on the plane when I finally got a moment to breathe, a moment of silence in my head to process everything. I didn't have to guard my thoughts, I didn't have to worry about losing my family by thinking about the wrong thing, and I could just ask myself questions. I asked myself \"Fine, if you're gonna think about this, what would you even call yourself if you were a woman?\" That familiar little voice that always answers from my unconscious whispered back \"Rachael\". I asked what my last name would be, and again \"Dawn\" was returned. Middle names? \"Elizabeth\". Rachael Elizabeth Dawn was born that day, and now that I had a name for myself? I felt like I was waking up for the first time.\n\nWhen I got home, I cried and I cried ***hard***. Everything came flooding out at once. \"No, I can't. It's not right, I'll lose everything\" ran through my head. I railed at the world, angry that I was like this. I cried harder, blaming my mother for bringing me in to this world just to be tortured alive like this. When the storm finally calmed, I felt I would try one last-ditch effort to suppress. One last hail mary to reclaim the \"man\" I was expected to be, and to prevent the risk of losing everything. I shaved my head to the scalp, first using clippers, then razers. It was the next day that I looked at myself in the mirror, the suppression technique having failed spectacularly. I asked myself one simple question.\n\n\"If you *could* take that little pink pill and permanently switch over, would you do it?\" Not a moment's hesitation and that little voice responded back \"I would give anything\". My fate was sealed in that moment. The resolve, determination, and unwavering laser-focus that everyone who knows me is familiar with came alive that yes, I would become a woman because I'd rather be me with nothing than a lie with everything. I had suffered long enough, and it was high time it stopped.\n\n## Coming Out\n\nMy coming out was remarkable from my perspective. It started on January 4th to myself, on the 7th to my psychiatrist, then slowly over the next couple weeks to everyone else. I had to cover my bases, with those closest to me being the first to know. I told the psychiatrist first because he would help me start my journey, and open the door for me. If I couldn't tell a psychiatrist, was I really ready?\n\nThe first person I told was my best friend, who I had confided in when I was 20/21 and told her I am Gender Fluid. I knew if I at least had her, I would be fine. I could lose everything else, but at least I would have 1 person left. She responded exactly as I had hoped, and from there, I started letting everyone know bit by bit. My sisters, some friends, some family. Eventually I worked up the courage to tell my father, which took a lot because of all people, losing him would hurt the most. I couldn't muster the courage to call him, and I couldn't even say \"I am trans\" to him. I just told him that I am transitioning to female. Guess what? He's just as accepting as my wildest hopes and dreams of him. Once my father knew, I let the world know. I came out on Facebook, then at work, and then I just let myself be me.\n\nAlmost 3 months later, and I still haven't had a *single* person say anything negative to me. People slip up and call me by my dead name, or use \"he / him / his\" instead of the \"she / her / hers\" that I prefer, but you know what? That's totally okay because it's a *transition* and those are slip ups. I slip up sometimes, especially when recounting the past and referring to myself. I don't actually understand what the \"accurate\" way to describe past me before I came out is, so I just use the one that makes the most sense: He / his since at the time, that's what I thought I was (or had to be).\n\nI've had 100% of my social network be accepting of me, and it is because of that I feel secure in sharing these deep, dark secrets. It is because I know that this information, despite having the capacity to be used as ammunition against me, could help people understand what it's like to be trans just a little bit more. Maybe if I'm lucky, it can encourage someone who is still an egg to break out of it and become themselves.\n\n## My doubts\n\nMy doubts are not so much doubts, as they are deeply seeded fears. I still feel those fears of judgment, of loss, and of rejection. They still flare up, and I battle them on the regular. They're starting to fade, getting less intense as time goes on, but they still come up. Here's what they sound like.\n\n*\"What if I get the surgery and I regret it?\"*\nYeah honestly, I might regret the surgery. It sure as hell won't be because I tried to be more \"me\", it'll be because of complications that result in me having a totally botched surgery. It'll be because when I look down, I see a *monster* from how wrong the surgery went. I'm learning to come to terms with this risk, and I accept it. The professionals who do this have done hundreds of trans women *every single year.* They're the pros, and there's *one place* in all of Canada that does this. \n\n*\"What if this is all wrong, and I'm just sick?\"*\nWhen this comes up, I remember everything I just shared with you in this article / story. I remember that I was sick *before*, when looking into a mirror meant I'd see a stranger. I remember how happy I feel being able to put on the clothes I like, being on hormones, and hearing my name.\n\n\"What if this isn't who I am meant to be?\"\nThis one, just like \"what if this is all wrong\", is an extension of \"I don't want to be judged\", and \"I am scared\". The moment I dig, the moment \"I don't want to lose everyone\" comes back up and I reassure myself.\n\n\"What if this is all in my head?\"\nThis one only needs a reminder of what my life has been like so far, and how much it changed as soon as I accepted myself.\n\n\"What if it's my ADHD meds making me happy, and not being out?\"\nWhat if it is? I'm still happy, and knowing that I can me adds onto it. I don't know how much either helps, but it *doesn't matter* because I am happy.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI wrote this in part because I feel like half of the battle trans people experience is that we aren't understood. We aren't understood because there's no information out there to understand, and the information that is out there is nearly impossible for the average person to stumble upon. We make up less than 1% of the population (estimated [0.6% in the USA](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/)), and because of that we are rare and unseen. It's made even more difficult because most of us *don't want to be seen*. We just want to be seen as the person we are, not as \"a trans woman\" or \"a trans man\", but as a man or a woman.\n\n\"I can't understand what you feel\" or \"I can't understand what you face\" is perfectly understandable, and it makes absolute sense to me. This is a sentiment shared by the majority of those whose generation comes before my own, and I can't blame them because the world they grew up in would chew people like me up, spit them out, and kill them. Suicide risk factors for trans people are *stupidly high*, and I'd bet anything that a huge contributor is lack of acceptance stemming from lack of understanding. Trans people [attempt suicide at all stages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7317390/) of transition and are [2x more likely to commit suicide with 22-44% having attempted it already](https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/transgender-people-suicide/). These are numbers coming from *today's day and age,* not when things were less progressive.\n\n[[notes/transgender/|Trans]]","lastmodified":"2023-04-02T16:24:12.160178463Z","tags":["trans"]},"/trans/understanding-gender":{"title":"A Trans Experience","content":"\nI am Rachael, a woman of transgender experience who has been living as my authentic self for a little over two years. I wrote an [article](trans/i-am-rachael.md) near the beginning of my journey to help people see an experience of a transgender individual up close and personal, including finer details that a lot of people would rather keep private. I share these details because it's difficult for anyone to humanize something if they don't know anything about it. More so, it is _easy_ to find an experience like mine rather confusing. If you haven't already, you should read that one first!\n\nI want to talk about a few things when it comes to me learning to understand myself on a deeper level with regard to my gender. The intuitive way to look at things is a lot like a line, where on one side you have \"Woman\", in the middle you have \"Non Binary\", and on the right you have \"Man\". I quickly found that this \"line\" actually confuses things, and does a disservice to anyone attempting to resolve issues with their gender. Before I can talk about the system I use, I want to clear up what I mean when I use specific terms.\n\n\n## Identifying\n\nIt's become almost a meme to \"identify as\" something, with common jokes including identifying as an Apache attack helicopter. Upon your first encounter with this sort of joke, you may find that annoying, funny, or not understand it at all. I want to clear this specific usage up because the words used are _super close_, but still not quite there.\n\nYou may have heard of people use \"mood\" to acknowledge that someone relates to a feeling or experience someone is expressing, or \"X is my spirit animal\". _That_ is what it means to identify with something on a basic level. Imagine now that level is deep, to your very core. Something so visceral that it almost consumes you in your attempt to explain to the outside world what you mean. Whether you lack the words to describe it, or you lack the awareness to tell what it is, identifying _with something_ is a universal human experience.\n\nYou can identify with the feeling of a joke being funny, of love being enriching, of betrayal hurting you, and of anger being difficult. However, if your experience of who you are is out of alignment with how the world treats you, there's a struggle to identify with that treatment. It doesn't necessarily have to be _bad_ treatment, just that it is treatment. You regard someone in a specific way when you see they are royalty, when they're a child, a senior, or a violent psychopath. These sorts of treatments are intrinsic, and you learn the patterns as you age. \n\nThis process of identifying with an experience is what I want you to focus on. I want you to take a moment, and imagine that there's something deeply wrong with your sense of reality. The way people treat you, the way you are expected to interact with the world, the way you have sex, and even the clothes or behaviours you are expected to exhibit. You are trying to be accepted, but every single way you present yourself feels misaligned and you can't identify with it. Almost like if you are expected to be angry all the time when you are a gentle, loving human being.\n\nYou go through your life and you encounter new situations you don't know the \"rules\" to. You haven't come across it before, so what do you do? You do what feels _natural_, or you observe what others are doing and copy them. You feel insecure because of your uncertainty, so you even try to pass that off with humour because that's the only way you know to break the tension in your lapse of being part of the situation organically. Let's say you did what feels natural, and all of a sudden you were criticized for it because it was \"too girly\" or \"too manly\". The _criticism_ feels bad, so when you combine that with your uncertainty driven insecurity, you feel embarrassed or ashamed. Your brain learns that this is \"not safe\", because if we were back in the times of living in caves being hunted by lions, isolation means that you are going to die.\n\nNow, imagine a lifetime of these situations. You go buy clothes, but you can't get the ones you want. You see toys in your childhood, but you're shut down for wanting the toys you like. You try to hang out with the girls, but get made fun of or excluded because you're not a girl, or vice versa. You've had a lifetime of situations where every attempt at natural social integration fails because you're expected to be different than you are. Now you have to live a lie, and pretend to be someone you're not because every single time you have tried to be authentic, you've received \"unsafe\" (remember: cave people brain) push-back every step of the way.\n\nThis is what it's like to not _identify with_ your own lived experience. When people say they \"identify as\", it's because they're trying to cross that barrier to their authentic selves. \"I identify as a man\" means that the person speaking underneath the flesh authentically _is_ a man, but their presentation or physiology may say otherwise to the outside world. It means they're trying to communicate with you \"Hey, something went wrong and what you see is not who I really am. If you communicate with me as you would the gender I identify as, it'll make it easier for me to be real with you.\"\n\nWith this foundation set, I want to move onto the model I used to figure myself out.\n\n## The model\n\n\u003e **Disclaimer**\n\u003e  I am not a psychologist, nor am I a psychiatrist. I am a transgender individual who struggled with my gender for a long time, and I have found what you are about to read brought me a significant amount of relief.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you cite or reference this, bear in mind that there are no studies, no scientific data, no information to back any of what I am presenting to you EXCEPT my personal lived experience.\n\nI realized that seeing the differences between men and women as a gradual line, as in it shifts along a line with a middle point clearly separating the two, didn't really work all that well. Every time I tried to understand myself through that model, it didn't work out the way I anticipated. Instead of clarity and confidence, I was left with insecurity and uncertainty. No, I don't like frilly white wedding dresses. No, I don't like barbies, (most) Disney movies, and gossip girl. So where does that leave me on the line? What about the things that are _traditionally male_, like the fact I like lego, video games, computers, or technology? How does it all stack up? They _don't_.\n\nInstead, I want you to disregard the line and instead think of categories of characteristics. These categories are: Physiology, Presentation and Tendencies, and Ungendered Characteristics. These categories are used to help you resolve your sense of gender more clearly, and is _NOT_ something that has been researched. This is a personal model that I used because it eased my _own_ struggles with my gender. I will first discuss these categories, then I will tell you how to use it.\n\n\u003e I will use phrases like \"feel like\", \"should have\", and other unclear terms and phrases in these following sections. While reading, remember that every time I use these, it is to unburden you from reading ridiculously complicated sentences. Remember that you should be searching within yourself for what you _identify with_.\n\n### Physiology\n\nThe physiology category is where you put your physical attributes. Do you feel breasts would be natural on you? Do you feel a penis or a vagina would be more natural? Do you _even care_ one way or another? The important part of the Physiology category is that they are _only physical attributes_ that are directly related to your body. When you think about this category, set aside your insecurities first and allow yourself to consider the experience of living with a different physiological makeup.\n\nIf you had a vagina, would you be comfortable with the implications? Would you feel comfortable being on the receiving end of having sex? If you had a penis, would you feel comfortable with that experience? What about breast-feeding, or having to wear a bra? Do these things feel like they are naturally in alignment with your sense of being?\n\nFor me, it looks like this:\n\n\u003e I feel a vagina is what I always should have had. The way I can sexually connect with those I am in a romantic relationship with feels incomplete without it, and attempting to use the genitals I was born with makes me feel hollow. I find myself feeling depressed as if I have lost something, and I motivate all my actions based on what _I_ would want if the roles were reversed. It also feels horribly violating to try to use the genitals I was born with in the way \"nature intended\", as if I am _literally raping myself_ and trying to be okay with it.\n\nMy categorization may feel extreme, but I want you to realize that this is _my_ experience. Yours may be entirely the same, or completely different. The key is to remember that you need to use _your_ experience and _your_ feelings. You may not care _at all_, and that's completely fine. You don't have to care, but not caring is _also_ a useful piece of information.\n\n### Presentation + Tendencies\n\n\u003e This category is _heavily cultural_, so bear in mind that I am speaking from a white Canadian perspective who was raised in a conservative part of my country, where even the term conservative is _relative_ to my country. Conservative in Saudi Arabia is _radically different_ from Conservative in Sweden, Canada, Italy, or the USA.\n\nHow do you feel you should be interacting with the world? What clothes do you feel are most natural, and how do you feel you should fit socially? How do you feel your voice should sound, and what habits do you feel are most natural? How do you categorize them, if at all? The presentation category has to do with how you interact with the _outside world_, and how you want the outside world to interact with you.\n\nThis is \"presenting as your gender\" for those who know the phrase. \"Present\" is to display, and those who receive what you are presenting are on the receiving end of your presentation. If you feel you would be most comfortable wearing makeup, wearing dresses, have a feminine voice, you would _also_ have expectations for how the world should naturally respond. This isn't you declaring \"the world should treat me this way\". This is you searching for how you'd present yourself _authentically_ to the world.\n\nThis includes your habits, behaviours, voice, choice of clothing, choice of makeup, everything that the _outside world_ can see and interact with.\n\n### Ungendered Characteristics\n\n\u003e There is literature that states that \"women are more interested in people, and men are more interested in things\". I want you to bear in mind that motivation counts. I like technology because it means I can _help people solve problems_. I am interested in how people can benefit from what I know and create. My \"thing\" interests are _human focused_, and my motivations are based on people.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you find yourself confused with anything that is true about yourself, put it here to resolve _later_ because self-discovery is a journey, not a checklist. If _you_ don't see that Lego is a thing with gender, _that itself is a piece of information_ you can use to put your characteristics here.\n\nThis category is a dumping ground for all the things that do _not_ have a gender relative to your experience. If you get the sense that liking Lego, video games, makeup, or any other thing is not a reflection of your experience with your gender, then feel free to place it here unless you feel it more appropriate to be placed somewhere else. This is your \"messy\" category for things that aren't cleanly gendered, or that you don't know if they reflect on your gender.\n\nThis category is important because not everything is about gender. I know it is tempting to put everything under the Gender categories, but for real. Owning an iPhone is NOT a gender attribute, neither is liking 3D printers, Ferrari super-cars, nice headphones, or anything else that is important to you. Gender is _not_ your entire being, and you should not attempt to gender your entire identity. It's probably not healthy to try to gender everything anyways, because there's absolutely no way that obsessing over everything needing to have a gender is healthy.\n\n\n## How do I use this?\n\nNow that you have a cleaner perspective of how to look at things, go ahead and think about  yourself. Consider your identity under these three categories, and consider where you fall _honestly_. Do you feel your experience is \"Woman\", \"Man\", or neither? Remember it's not a line, but Man and Woman _are valid, traditional, and COMMON experiences_ of gender. If you are born with a penis, and find yourself a man, then congratulations! You don't have to suffer through a dysphoric experience of reality, and that's awesome!\n\nThe important thing to remember here is that you want to detect within yourself what the most accurate assessment is. If you cannot cleanly \"find yourself\" (I used this phrasing intentionally) as a man or woman, then this is where non-binary comes into play. There is a significant resistance in society against non-binary experiences. If you do not understand non-binary, now you do. It is an experience of one's reality that doesn't _align_ with Man or Woman. It's only _called_ non-binary because we have used the Man and Woman model for _SO LONG_ that Non Binary can be seen as more of a placeholder, or as an \"I don't know, but it sure ain't those two\". It may even be seen as a neutral in-between, or that you simply _do not care at all_, and experience no distress one way or the other.\n\nYou want to be truthful with yourself here. You cannot _declare_ yourself a woman, a man, non-binary, agender, two-spirit, or anything else. The cleanest thing you can do is to _find yourself_ by just being true to who you are, and seeing if there's a term you can use that resembles the experience you identify with most.\n\n## Where do you (Rachael) fall?\n\nFor me, this stacked up as \"Woman\" with a few tomboy tendencies. Since I have come to this conclusion, I have felt nothing but peace in the idea, and only frustration in my dysphoria when I have to combat the realities of having a misalignment in my physiology. I still find myself saddened that I do not (yet) have a vagina, and I find myself struggling for a sense of peace with the reality that I will not be able to bear a child. I don't feel the need to wear skirts until I want to, and I honestly don't have to put much thought into my gender anymore.\n\nFor me that problem is resolved. I am Rachael, a woman of transgender experience who is a bit of a tomboy, who likes the things I like, and is interested in helping bring the world hope in any way I can. I don't have to reconsider, wonder, struggle with, or be confused by my gender anymore. I simply take actions to get closer to the authentic, highest version of myself in all that I do. \n\nI genuinely hope that if you are struggling with your sense of gender that this helped. If you find it more difficult to see your experience using this model, _don't use it_. It's _my_ model that I came up with as a system to ease my own pain. It's not backed by psychological literature in any way, but it feels the most intuitively correct to me and has provided significantly more peace to my life.\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-02T16:24:12.160178463Z","tags":["trans"]}}
