title: "Resources for Beginners"

## Getting started
In order to get started programming, you honestly just need to try a bit of programming and see what you think. There are a lot of free resources out there in the world, and here are a few options I want to show you. I'm going to use a lot of terms going through this article. Please reference the [[terms]] section if any jargon on this page confuses you.


##### The Odin Project
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a spectacular website. It is completely open source with web-based front-end development. If you don't know what this means, it means that you can make apps that exist inside of a web browser like Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.

##### FreeCodeCamp
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a website that is _shockingly good_ in its design and what they teach you. They don't assume prior knowledge at all, and like the Odin Project, it teaches you web-based front-end development.

##### Meta's Courses on Coursera
Meta (the company behind Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and Oculus) created a course on a website called   [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) (which is a lot like [Udemy](https://udemy.com) for those unfamiliar). Meta posted a  [Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) for their Front-End development, as well as a [back-end](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-back-end-developer) course.

#### W3Schools
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) isn't the best for absolute beginners, but it's a great reference for the different parts of Web development. You wouldn't use this for things you _don't_ know, but instead for things you're vaguely aware of. You'd go here just to look for how things work, where other reference websites are too complex. This is where you'd get _basics_ with examples that you can try out.
